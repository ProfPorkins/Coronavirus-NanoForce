# Levels

A level is the game play environment in which the game takes place.  This includes things like the background image, what music to play (if enabled), max number of viruses, various messages that can appear, finding a safe starting position for the player, along with a few other things.  When I started the game I had grander visions (doesn't everyone) for what the levels would be like.  Originally I planed to have levels much larger than a single screen in which a player would navigate around and clean out the viruses.  Because this is something I do in my spare time for _fun_, I quickly realized I wasn't going to have the time to meet my original vision, at least in the time-frame I set aside to work on this game.

While working on the documentation, I decided to take the time to reduce some of the unnecessary complexity I had in the code from my original _grand_ design.  The code is now more simplified than it was at the time of release.  The code I revised wasn't that much more complicated, it just had more separation of duties into several classes that isn't necessary with the current simple level design.

The following diagram provides an overview of levels in this code.
